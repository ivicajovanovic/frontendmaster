# Tone Ladder

## Levels

- `Reserved Prestige`: discreet, exact, low-noise
- `Editorial Authority`: cultured, confident, explanatory
- `Experiential Warmth`: sensory, inviting, controlled emotion

## Rules

Use one dominant tone and one secondary tone.
Avoid mixing all three equally.
Prefer short, declarative phrasing for strategic claims.
Remove slang, hype adjectives, and startup buzzwords.
