# Palette Reference

## Core Principle

Use a limited palette with deliberate contrast and material depth.

## Recommended Structure

Define:
- one dominant neutral base
- one secondary neutral for layering
- one accent color for action and emphasis
- one optional metallic or warm tone for luxury cues

## Usage Rules

Keep accent usage below 10-15% of visible area.
Use neutrals for most surfaces and typography framing.
Reserve high chroma moments for CTA, active states, or key data points.

## Black and White Foundation

Use near-black and warm-white anchors instead of pure extremes.
Retain a slight material softness to avoid sterile output.

## Prohibited Patterns

Avoid rainbow palettes, random gradients, and overused purple neon.
Avoid multiple competing accents in one viewport.
