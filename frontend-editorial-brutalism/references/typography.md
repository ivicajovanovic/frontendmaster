# Typography Reference

## Core Principle

Let typography carry the brand voice before color, texture, or ornament.

## Pairing Strategy

Use one expressive serif display family and one neutral sans family.
Keep the sans family for utility text, navigation, and data.
Reserve expressive serif usage for hero headlines, pull quotes, and section openers.

## Role System

Use fixed roles and avoid ad-hoc sizing:
- `display-xl`: hero statement
- `display-l`: section opener
- `lead`: short narrative support text
- `body`: primary reading text
- `meta`: labels, specs, timestamps, captions

## Tracking and Line Length

Use slight negative tracking for large display text.
Use neutral or slight positive tracking for all-caps labels.
Keep body line length around 60-78 characters.

## Hierarchy Rules

Use size contrast first, then weight contrast, then color contrast.
Avoid using all three at maximum intensity in the same block.
Limit the number of concurrent text styles visible in one viewport.

## Luxury Tone Controls

Prefer calm punctuation and concise copy blocks.
Use uppercase sparingly for authority accents only.
Avoid loud gradient text, outlined novelty headlines, and decorative distortion.
