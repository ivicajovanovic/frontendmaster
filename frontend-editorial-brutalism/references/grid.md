# Grid Reference

## Core Principle

Build strict structure first, then introduce controlled breaks.

## Base Grid

Use a modular column system with consistent gutters.
Use larger outer margins to signal premium spacing.
Anchor major modules to shared vertical rhythm units.

## Asymmetry Model

Place one dominant anchor block and one counterweight block.
Break alignment intentionally in one axis at a time.
Keep text readability stable even when visual blocks shift.

## Responsive Logic

Prioritize content legibility over preserving desktop geometry.
Collapse asymmetry progressively on tablet and mobile.
Keep focal hierarchy identical across breakpoints.

## Spacing Discipline

Use a tokenized spacing scale and avoid arbitrary values.
Increase section spacing for narrative pacing.
Avoid dense stacking of cards and repeated modules.

## Grid Break Rules

Break the grid only to emphasize:
- hero statement
- art image intrusion
- key CTA moment

After each break, return to structural alignment.
