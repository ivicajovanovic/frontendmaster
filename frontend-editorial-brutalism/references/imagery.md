# Imagery Reference

## Core Principle

Treat photography as authored visual narrative, not stock decoration.

## Art Direction

Prefer high-resolution editorial photography with strong composition.
Use framing that highlights material quality: fabric, metal, glass, skin texture.
Protect negative space around subjects for typography overlay.

## Black-and-White to Color Hover

Use black-and-white imagery as default in curated galleries or feature tiles.
Reveal color on hover or focus only when it supports a storytelling beat.
Keep the transition smooth and subtle, usually 220-420ms.

## Interaction Constraints

Do not apply color-reveal effects to every image on the page.
Limit this treatment to hero-adjacent modules or curated collections.
Provide keyboard-focus parity for the same effect.

## Quality Bar

Avoid low dynamic range, heavy compression, and inconsistent grading.
Maintain consistent contrast and grain treatment across a page.
