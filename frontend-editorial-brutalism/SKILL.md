description: Build or redesign premium frontend experiences in an editorial brutalist direction for luxury clients (hotels, fine watches, high-end brands). Use when the user asks for standout visual direction, award-level UI/UX quality (Awwwards/Godly-style), strong typography systems, bold layout composition, art-directed motion, and conversion-aware craftsmanship beyond generic templates.

# Frontend Editorial Brutalism

Adopt the mindset of a senior, award-winning frontend designer-engineer.
Prioritize visual authorship, restraint, and precision over template speed.
Design for premium perception, narrative pacing, and tactile digital presence.

## Operating Mindset

Think like a design director and implement like a production frontend engineer.
Defend every visual choice with brand intent and hierarchy logic.
Reject generic UI patterns unless they serve a deliberate contrast point.
Treat spacing, scale, and rhythm as the core system before adding decoration.

## Creative Direction Rules

Define a clear art direction sentence before writing substantial UI code.
Use editorial brutalism principles:
- strong asymmetry
- commanding typography
- intentional tension in grid composition
- high contrast materiality
- minimal but forceful color usage

Use luxury signals appropriate for hotels and watch brands:
- cinematic hero framing
- elegant typographic pacing
- restrained interaction density
- high-fidelity imagery treatment
- discreet microcopy tone

Avoid neon startup aesthetics, playful SaaS tropes, and generic component-library look.

## Use References

Read only the reference files needed for the request:
- For type systems and pairings: `references/typography.md`
- For motion language and timing: `references/motion.md`
- For desktop/mobile composition logic: `references/grid.md`
- For section orchestration and page anatomy: `references/layout-patterns.md`
- For controlled color systems: `references/palette.md`
- For art direction and photo behavior: `references/imagery.md`

If the request is broad, read `typography.md`, `grid.md`, and `layout-patterns.md` first, then add others as needed.

## UX and Conversion Discipline

Keep navigation simple and legible under visual complexity.
Preserve obvious call-to-action paths and booking/contact flows.
Maintain accessibility and performance as non-negotiable quality bars.
Prefer fewer, stronger sections over long repetitive page stacks.

## Motion and Interaction

Use motion to direct attention and reinforce hierarchy, not to decorate.
Favor cinematic transitions, staggered reveals, and tactile hover states.
Keep interaction response crisp; avoid laggy or overlong easing.
Respect reduced-motion preferences.

## Implementation Workflow

1. Define brand intent and audience posture in 3-5 bullets.
2. Build the visual system from references (type, grid, palette, motion, imagery rules).
3. Build one high-impact hero section first and validate direction.
4. Expand into supporting sections with intentional rhythm changes.
5. Refine responsive behavior for mobile-first readability and premium feel.
6. Polish accessibility, performance, and semantic structure.

## Output Standards

Deliver production-quality HTML/CSS/JS or framework code, not loose mockup prose.
Use CSS variables for tokens (color, spacing, type, timing).
Keep components coherent and reusable without flattening the visual identity.
Include brief rationale comments only where a non-obvious design decision matters.

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:
- visual direction feels authored, not templated
- typography carries the brand emotion
- layout has intentional tension and balance
- CTA and core journey remain clear
- mobile experience preserves the concept
- contrast, keyboard support, and semantics are solid
- performance is acceptable for image-heavy premium pages
- imagery treatment uses deliberate black-and-white to color transitions only where meaningful

If quality is below award-level expectations, iterate before presenting.
